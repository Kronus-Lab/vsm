# Contributing to VSM
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Make sure your code lints (pylint default settings).
3. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the Apache 2.0 License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [Apache 2.0 License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/Kronus-Lab/vsm/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

Please write bug reports with detail and background

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
Coding style is done following the PEP-8 standard. You can ensure you are compliant by using `autopep8` which is installed by pipenv automatically.

## License
By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its Apache 2.0 License.
